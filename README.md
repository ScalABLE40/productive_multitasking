### Productive Multitasking

To run part of the code used in the paper "Productive Multitasking for Industrial Robots" published at ICRA 2021, simply execute `behavior_tree.py` or `finite_state_machine.py` with Python 3. The only dependency is `numpy`. The output shows how the behavior tree and the finite state machine evolve in an example of execution.
