# Productive Multitasking for Industrial Robots

[digest]: images/preemption.png "(top) Execution of a place skill in order to dispatch a piston rod on the tray of an AGV,
    while a disk is being detected on the conveyor belt.
    (bottom) Since this conveyor belt is running at a constant speed,
    waiting for the place skill to terminate would result in missing the opportunity to pick up the disk;
    the place skill is put on hold in order to start a pick skill directed towards the disk."

This repository lets you see and run an isolated version of the state machine/behavior tree code behind the paper "Productive Multitasking for Industrial Robots"
published at ICRA 2021:

## Installation (Windows, MacOS, Linux)

Install Python 3 with `numpy`.

## Usage

Simply execute `src/behavior_tree.py` or `src/finite_state_machine.py`.
The output shows how the behavior tree and the finite state machine evolve in two examples of simulated execution.
